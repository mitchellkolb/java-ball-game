# What I Learned in this Project
- Programming fundamentals for Java
- 



# Tools Used / Development Environment

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on our local machine inside of a virtual machine using:
- **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Follow instructions from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [Oracle](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/develop.html).
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../java-ball-game/BallGame/`
- Use this command to compile the codebase
```zsh
javac *.java
```
- Use this command to run the program.
```zsh
java BallGame 1 basic 0.08 
```
- The following arguments will be passed to the game in the command line: 
`# of balls`,  `ball type`,  `ball radius` 
- ball type and  ball radius will be repeated for each ball. 

For example: 
`4 basic 0.10 bounce 0.05 shrink 0.13 split 0.05`
