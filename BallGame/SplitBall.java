 * The splitball calls another instance of the ball into the game.
 * This file is just a joke now that I wrote it out becuase I call the new instance of the ball in the main class and not here
 * This file just calls the basicball class and allows me to call the ball in question as splitball so thats cool
 * Nothing else happens besides this
